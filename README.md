# ETH-AVAX_Project

# Introduction
This is a project in which ,our task is to create a ERC20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract should have the following functionality:

1. Minting new tokens:

The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.

2.Transferring tokens: 

Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.

3. Redeeming tokens:
   
Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.

4. Checking token balance:

Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.

5. Burning tokens:

Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed


# Contract Details
 To configure Hardhat to work with Avalanche by default, the first step is to add Avalanche to its supported chains. For initial testing purposes, we will use Avalanche's Fuji test network, a C-Chain test network that allows us to test our smart contracts. Once everything is thoroughly tested and working as expected, we can deploy it to Avalanche's Mainnet.
 



# Deploying the contract
Now, we need to deploy our smart contract. First, we are going to deploy our Token to testnet. 

You have a wallet setup on your browser, we now need to connect to the Fuji Testnet, and add the network to your wallet.

Hereâ€™s all the information that a wallet like Metamask requires to connect to a chain:

Network Name: Avalanche Fuji C-Chain New RPC URL: https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc ChainID: 43113 Symbol: AVAX Explorer: https://testnet.snowtrace.io/

Now, you can connect your wallet using the ðŸ¦Š Connect button, or you can paste your address directly. Remember, these are test tokens and have no value, but you can only request a few tokens per day.
